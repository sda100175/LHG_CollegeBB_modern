# Team Decoder

This is a utility built in QuickBasic that takes a LH CBB "BASK" data file (which is in a binary format) and outputs the data inside of it to a simple text-based JSON data file.

It is in a good state now from the fields pulled from HELLO.BAS, but there are still some other fields I'm not getting that are in the team editor:

ARENA NAME
NICKNAME
COACH
AVG ATTENDANCE
