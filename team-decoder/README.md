# Team Decoder

This is a utility built in QuickBasic that takes a LH CBB "BASK" data file (which is in a binary format) and outputs the data inside of it to a simple text-based JSON data file.

Usage: DECODE <year>

Make sure both the BASK and COLBBTMS files for the year are in the same directory as you execute the file in.

Generates a TeamData.<year>.json file.
